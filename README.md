Project Overview:

My-pet is a virtual pet desktop application designed to mitigate university student stress and promote mental well-being alongside academic success. Moving beyond traditional productivity tools, it integrates elements of emotional support, memory preservation, and interactive learning into a single, engaging platform. The application personifies a student's academic journey as a caring companion, fostering a routine of daily mindfulness and consistent study habits.

Key Features & Functional Modules:

Virtual Pet Companion: At the heart of the application is an interactive virtual pet. Students are encouraged to engage in a brief, calming daily check-in by "petting" their buddy. This simple, tactile interaction is designed to provide a moment of stress relief and build a consistent, positive routine.

Memory Gallery ("Memeriory Gallary"): A dedicated digital scrapbook where students can upload photos and captions of their favorite university moments. This feature encourages reflection on positive experiences, fostering a sense of gratitude and community, which is crucial for combating burnout and loneliness.

Pop-Up Quizzer: An interactive learning module that presents users with daily, bite-sized quizzes. This tool facilitates consistent knowledge reinforcement and exam preparation in a low-pressure, gamified format, helping to transform sporadic cramming into a manageable daily habit.

Centralized Lecture Notes Storage: A secure and organized digital repository for all lecture notes. This eliminates the stress of lost or disorganized materials, providing students with a single, reliable source of truth for their study materials and promoting academic confidence.

Dynamic Goal List & Progress Tracker: An integrated task manager that allows students to set, manage, and track progress toward both academic and personal goals. Visualizing progress provides a sense of accomplishment and helps break down overwhelming projects into achievable steps, directly reducing anxiety.

Technical Implementation & Value Proposition:

StudyBuddy is likely built using object-oriented principles, with a modular architecture separating the core pet simulation, data persistence for notes and memories, and the UI for each functional module. The value of this project lies in its human-centered design, addressing the multifaceted nature of student stress by combining:

Emotional Support through the virtual pet.

Positive Psychology via the memory gallery.

Academic Reinforcement with the quizzer and notes storage.

Productivity & Motivation through the goal-tracking system.
